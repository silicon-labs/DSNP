# Package configure time, in which case one DSNPd can serve only a single kind of user agent. Idea being it is more secure and simpler.
# Software configuration time. Not really less secure since conf files are now owned by root and not writable by the network-facing processes. Will allow multiple types of user agents to run on a single host -- perhaps should override all other concerns.
