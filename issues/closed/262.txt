Previously we could rely on the username and site forming the base to these paths. No longer true. We don't know how the URI is constructed. The paths for remote items should be full. They should be rooted at the remote host or contain the host. If they contain the host then we allow references to objects at other hosts ... is that a good idea ... possibly for content servers.
